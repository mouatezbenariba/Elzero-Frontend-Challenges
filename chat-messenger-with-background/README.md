## What I learned

- I learned 2 more ways of drawing triangles in CSS (border, clip-path and background-image: linear-gradient()). You can check Alvaro Montoro's blog post on [drawing a triangle with CSS](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/67970/drawing-a-triangle-with-css), it was very helpful.
- The limitation of using clip-path in drawing triangles led me to explore the difference between `drop-shadow` and `box-shadow` (In summary, `box-shadow` creates a shadow effect around the entire element, while `drop-shadow` applies a shadow effect only to the transparent parts of an element, ignoring its content.)
- To change the size of an SVG Font Awesome Icon, you only need to change the height of the `<svg>` element.
