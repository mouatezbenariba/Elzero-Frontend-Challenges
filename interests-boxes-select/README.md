# Elzero Frontend Challenge - Interests Boxes Select

## Welcome üëã

Hello and welcome to my solution for the **Interests Boxes Select** frontend challenge from [Elzero Web School](https://elzero.org/category/challenges/front-end-challenges/).

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build a List of Interest Boxes. The design for the challenge was provided in the form of an image.

## Requirements

- The element used to select the boxes is a checkbox.

- The elements "Web" and "Coding" have been selected.

- The "Scheme" element has a hover effect applied to it only, and the appearance changes when hovering over the checkbox only.

- When hovering, the same color appears in the checkbox, but with lower opacity.

- If you hover over one of the selected elements (checked), the opacity of the checkbox color should not change.

- You can use any icons of your choice.

## Challenges

- JavaScript is strictly prohibited.

- The use of any libraries that create custom checkboxes is not allowed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Used Icons

- I used Flaticon [Icon Pack: Coding | Outline](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/coding-74) of edt.im.
